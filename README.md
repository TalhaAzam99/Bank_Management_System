A Bank Management System without GUI is a console-based or command-line application that manages basic banking operations using text input and output. The system is designed to handle customer accounts and banking transactions efficiently without using any graphical interface.

This system allows users to perform essential banking functions such as creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing funds, checking account balance, and viewing customer details through a terminal or command prompt. All interactions are done using keyboard commands and displayed as text.

The system stores customer information like account number, account holder name, account type, and balance in files or data structures. It ensures data accuracy by validating user input and checking conditions such as sufficient balance before withdrawal.

A non-GUI bank management system is mainly used for learning purposes, small-scale applications, or backend logic development. It helps students understand core programming concepts such as file handling, loops, conditional statements, functions, and object-oriented programming.

Because it does not include a graphical interface, the system is lightweight, fast, and easy to run on low-resource computers. It focuses on functionality and logic rather than design and visual appearance.

In conclusion, a Bank Management System without GUI is a reliable and efficient text-based application that performs basic banking operations and is commonly used in educational environments to demonstrate fundamental software development principles.
